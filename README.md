# A Sandbox for to.science

This Repository is for investigating parts of the to.science code outside the rather annoying and complex playFramework. The latter often prevents me from finding call hierarchies within Eclipse. Therefore I eventually decided to re-model parts of the code for a better understanding by using Maven etc.

## Usage with Eclipse

1. git checkout 
2. import as Maven-Project into eclipse
3. run CheckResolvers.java or ProbeRDFUtils as Java-Application 

## Feel free to enhance the Sandbox with our investigations ;-)
